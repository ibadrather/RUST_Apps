If you follow the instructions in the official Rust book, you will do all of your work using Cargo. The book introduces Cargo in the first chapter. 99.5% of Rust developers never use rustc directly, and doing so is simply going to lead you to pain.

Cargo automatically sets up a directory structure where build artifacts go into the target directory and this directory is added to .gitignore. You have nothing else to do.

You could do the same thing by hand and ignore the build output directory (you really shouldn't though, it's not worth it to avoid Cargo)

	$ mkdir target
	$ rustc -o target/example example.rs
	$ ./target/example
	$ echo 'target/' >> .gitignore
